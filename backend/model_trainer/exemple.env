# .env.example for the Model Trainer Service

# --- General Configuration ---

# The logging level for the application.
# Recommended Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
LOG_LEVEL=INFO


# --- Data and Pipeline Configuration ---

# Path to the training data file inside the Docker container.
# This path is determined by the Dockerfile's `COPY` command.
DATA_FILE_PATH=/app/data/mushroom_decoded.csv

# The name of the target column in the dataset (the one to be predicted).
TARGET_COL=poisonous

# The value of the positive label in the target column.
# Used for calculating metrics like precision and recall. For the mushroom dataset, it's 'p'.
POS_LABEL=p


# --- Model Training Hyperparameters ---

# The proportion of the dataset to allocate to the test split.
# Must be a float between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.3 for 30%).
TEST_SIZE=0.3

# Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducible data splits.
# Any integer is valid.
RANDOM_STATE=42

# Smoothing parameter (alpha) for the Naive Bayes model.
# Must be a float. 1.0 is standard for Laplace smoothing.
ALPHA=1.0


# --- Data Preprocessing and Validation ---

# A comma-separated list of column names to drop from the dataset before training.
# Example: stalk-root,some-other-column
COLUMNS_TO_DROP=stalk-root

# Whether to remove rows from the test set that contain feature values not seen in the training set.
# Options: True or False
VALIDATE_TEST_SET=True

# The minimum required accuracy for the model to be considered valid after training.
# Must be a float between 0.0 and 1.0. If accuracy is below this, the service will fail to start.
MIN_ACCURACY=0.8
